  CICD Platform is an AWS CodePipeline generator that simplifies pipeline
  creation by automating building, unit testing, code style linting, and
  deploying tasks. As a fully managed continuous delivery service, it leverages
  CDK, CloudFormation, and CodeBuild to streamline AWS CodePipeline
  infrastructure. This DevOps platform helps teams manage and automate their
  CI/CD processes efficiently. With CiFlex, DevOps teams can create and publish
  plugins to introduce new features and enhance their CI/CD workflows.
  Additionally, it integrates with ServiceCatalog to provide a comprehensive
  solution for managing CodePipeline setups.
