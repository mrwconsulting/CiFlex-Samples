The CiFlex CICD Platform is an AWS CodePipeline generator, streamlining pipeline creation by simplifying configuration for tasks such as building, unit testing, code style linting, and deploying. It's a fully managed continuous delivery service that automates AWS CodePipeline infrastructure, empowering DevOps teams to efficiently manage and automate their pipeline processes. With CiFlex, DevOps teams can create and publish plugins to introduce new features, enabling application teams to easily enhance their CICD workflows.

## **Benefits of CiFlex CICD Platform:**

* **Self-Mutating CICD Pipeline**: CiFlex plugins can be dynamically added, updated with new values, or removed without coding, enabling a pipeline to reconfigure itself to deploy new or updated stages. Pipelines will automatically update based on configuration files submitted by application teams.

* **Plugin-Based Architecture**: With a plugin-based architecture, DevOps teams can effortlessly extend functionality by creating or modifying plugins. This empowers application teams to swiftly incorporate new capabilities into their pipelines, adapting to changing requirements with ease.

* **Authorization**: CiFlex prioritizes security by leveraging AWS Cognito services to protect its APIs with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This ensures that application teams must authenticate to create and provision pipelines, guaranteeing secure access and maintaining data integrity.

* **AWS Service Catalog Integration**: Streamline pipeline creation and provisioning with seamless integration into the AWS Service Catalog. Centralize management of pipeline resources to enhance efficiency and governance for application teams.

* **Pipeline-Level Variables** : Both stages and steps expose pipeline variables to be easily consumed by other stages and steps. These pipeline-level variables are fully customizable, allowing you to define their names and values.

* **Command-Line Inteface**: A unified tool that offers a consistent interface for interacting with CiFlex APIs.

### **FAQ**
Q. What are the environment variables used to configure CiFlexctl?<br>
A. Here are a few common ones. See the documentation for more details.<br>
<ol>export CIFLEX_TOKEN="license token"<br>
export CIFLEX_ACCESS_TOKEN="your access token" **"CiFlex access token, created by Cognito"**<br>
export VPC_ID="your vpc id" **"Target AWS VPC for setup"**<br></ol>

Q. Can we add our own stages and steps?<br>
A. Certainly! You can add your own custom stages \ steps to a pipeline by including them in the YAML file that defines the pipeline. This allows you to tailor the pipeline to your specific requirements and workflows.<br>

Q. Can we create our own plugins or update existing ones?<br>
A. Yes, use ciflexctl<br>
<ol>ciflexctl plugins --help</ol>

Q. Can different pipelines be deployed based on a branch in our software development process?<br>
A. Yes, create pipeline properties file. Here's example:[pipeline.properties]<br>
<ol>[branch name]: [pipeline configuration file]<br>
main: pipeline.yaml<br>
dev: pipeline-dev.yaml</ol>

Q. How do I disable a pipeline stage?<br>
A. Both stages and steps can be disabled by setting the 'isActive' attribute to 'false'. Here's an example<br>
<ol>- stageName: DeployStage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pluginName: Manual-Approval<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;isActive: false **"this disable entire stage"**</ol>
